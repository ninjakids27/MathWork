# MathWork
my math work in java that I coded throughout my junior in high school.
This contains mostly math im interested in and projects done. This is not really a consisstent github
and I just use it for some slop like physics labs or Stat HW. I've also used this for my ML project from scratch.
Don't use this as a serious library

# ML Project: 
The objective of the project is to make a deep neural network recognize hand written digits. It's mostly a learning experience
and I don't have a lot of patience to optimize the code any further or make it any better.

# How to get the ML Project to work:
clone the repo to your IDE and make sure JDK is installed then run DrawApp.java
for the demo.
