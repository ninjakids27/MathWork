# MathWork
my math work in java that I coded throughout my junior in high school.
This contains mostly math im interested in and projects done. This is not really a consisstent github
and I just use it for some slop like physics labs or Stat HW. I've also used this for my ML project from scratch.
Don't use this as a serious library

# ML Project: 
The objective of the project is to make a deep neural network recognize hand written digits. It's mostly a learning experience
and I don't have a lot of patience to optimize the code any further or make it any better.

# TODO LIST:
## November 2025: 
ML
- [ ] Do Backpropagation (P1)
    - [x] implement box muller transform method for sampling (P1) 
    - [ ] Do He initilization using a normal distribution to initilize the weights (P1)
    - [ ] Write a loss function (P2)
    - [ ] Write a cost function (P2)
    - [ ] Possibly need to review MVC for BP (~P3)
- [ ] Tensor class? do more research in the future and write it up in the notes (~P3)
- [ ] Write the training method and implement parallel processing using CUDA (P2)
- [x] Make more models (P1)

MatrixOps
- [ ] Single Value decomposition for compressing images (P1)
    - [ ] research Single Value Decomposition (P1)
    - [ ] write notes (P2)

NEATNESS
- [ ] reorder the structure of a NN to be more readable via a layer class and NN class (P1)
- [ ] Write more docs (P1)
- [ ] Update the notes to what is relevant in the files (P1)
