## December 2025: 
### ML
- [x] implement training method to train the NN (P1)
- [x] Do Backpropagation (P1)
    - [x] implement Adam as an optimizer algorithm for the learning rate (P1)
    - [x] implement SGD
    - [x] implement SGD with momentum
    - [x] implement the softmax function (P1)
    - [x] implement box muller transform method for sampling (P1) 
    - [x] Do He initilization using a uniform distribution to initilize the weights (P1)
    - [x] Write a loss function (P2) // post it's the same thing as the cost function so it's just MSE
